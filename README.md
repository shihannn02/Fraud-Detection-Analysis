### Fraud Detection Analysis using Spark

Due to the development of information technology, big data collection, analysis, and storage has become an important component of many industries. Josphineleela et al [[1]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/369846162_Big_Data_Security_through_Privacy_-_Preserving_Data_Mining_PPDM_A_Decentralization_Approach) pointed out that big data refers to data with a large volume, large file size, and fast speed, which not only provide huge potential for industries, but also introduce a series of data security challenges. Big data security, as an important branch of IT, aims to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of large-scale data. Enterprises mainly face several prominent data security issues, such as insufficient data access control, insufficient data analysis capabilities, resulting in frequent occurrence of data security issues[[2]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10206137). Therefore, the urgent task for enterprises is to develop security management measures based on the big data lifecycle to address security issues.
